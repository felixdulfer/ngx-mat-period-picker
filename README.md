A modern Angular Material period picker component built with standalone components.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

npm install @felixdulfer/ngx-mat-period-picker
```

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

```typescript
import { PeriodPickerComponent } from "@felixdulfer/ngx-mat-period-picker";

@Component({
  selector: "app-my-component",
  standalone: true,
  imports: [PeriodPickerComponent],

```

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.2.15.

## Development server

To start a local development server, make sure you have a build of the lib:

```bash
npx -p @angular/cli@20 ng build ngx-mat-period-picker --watch
```

To run the demo app, run:

```bash
npx -p @angular/cli@20 ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
npx -p @angular/cli@20 ng build @felixdulfer/ngx-mat-period-picker
```

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
npx ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
